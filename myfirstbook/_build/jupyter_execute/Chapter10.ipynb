    "Dynamic programming (DP) is a method used in algorithm design to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem just once, storing its solution. This technique is particularly useful for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, meaning the solution to the problem can be composed of solutions to its subproblems. By storing the solutions to these subproblems, DP avoids redundant calculations, significantly improving efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches to dynamic programming: the top-down approach, known as memoization, and the bottom-up approach, known as tabulation. In memoization, the problem is solved recursively, and results of solved subproblems are stored for future use. In tabulation, the problem is solved iteratively, building up solutions from the smallest subproblems to the overall problem. Both approaches help transform exponential time complexity problems into polynomial time complexity problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is widely used to solve various algorithmic problems such as the Fibonacci sequence, the knapsack problem, and the longest common subsequence. These problems benefit from the efficiency and optimal solutions provided by DP, making it a fundamental technique in computer science for tackling complex computational challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in this chapter we will consider two concepts of DP and three LeetCode problems for better understanding.\n",
